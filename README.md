## About App
This is a simple note application for my Patika.dev homework.
* I use ChakraUI for UI elements.
* Built with React and Redux.
* .Net 5 (C#) for API service.

## Getting Started

* Run `git clone https://github.com/p0rt1a/Note-App.git`

* Locate /server/api and run `dotnet run` to start API service.
* Locate /client folder and run `npm install` to install missing packages.
* Create .env file in /client and name your environment object as "REACT_APP_BASE_ENDPOINT=your_api_port_here".
* After installation complete, run `npm start` and take some notes!
